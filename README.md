# React - With webpack and babel

## Scripts

`npm start` - To start the server.
`npm build` - To build the app and get static files.
`npm lint` - To run linter and get the report.

## Notes

- Favicon uses a plugin `favicons-webpack-plugin` for dev. In case of changin the favicon please refer to `webpack.common.js`
- Handled most of the test types for images, in case of new image format please edit `webpack.common.js`
- There are different webpack config for `prod` and `dev`
